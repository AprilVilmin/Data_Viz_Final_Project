# Predicting Quarter 3 & 4 Covid Cases for 2022

### Data Source:
- Using Covid Dataset from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
- We will be using SQL Database for this project
- Tables used for this project: us-counties-2020.csv, us-counties-2021.csv and us-counties-2022 files
- Using Housing Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/thuynyle/hawai-i-s-housing-market-post-covid/data

### Data Cleansing:

- Dropping Fips column from the covid dataset
- Creating a combined key to join tables using county/state from covid datasets
- Using the housing dataset, we have dropped years before 2020 in the spreadsheet to make it easier
- We will drop uncessary columns from the housing dataset

### Reasons why we selected the topic:
 -  It is something that affects everyone.
 -  Given historical data, we want to predict future cases for 3 and 4 quarter for 2022
 
### Questions we hope to answer:
- What will be the covid cases for Q2 & Q3 of 2022 by County and State
- Discover Covid 19 trends across multiple years

### Machine Learning Model:
- Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks/Google Colab for learning model
- Regression or Unsupervised machine learning
- Inputs: TBD
- Output/Target: Number of positive COVID cases in a county/state
- Output/Target: To determine if house prices increased or decreased as the covid cases increased or decreased
