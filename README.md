# Predicting Quarter 3 & 4 Covid Cases for 2022

##  Using Covid Dataset from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
- Using SQL Database 
- Merging us-counties-2020.csv, us-counties-2021.csv and us-counties-2022 files
- Dropping Fips column - as there are different levels of fips and we thing it would be more efficient to use a combined concatenated key of county/state

## Reasons why we selected the topic
 -  It is something that affects everyone
 -  Given historical data, we want to predict future cases for 3 and 4 quarter for 2022
